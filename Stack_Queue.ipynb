    "### Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure. The main operations are `push` (to add an element to the top) and `pop` (to remove the top element).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stack Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **push()**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = []\n",
    "   stack.append(1)\n",
    "   stack.append(2)\n",
    "   print(stack)  # Output: [1, 2]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **pop()**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   top_element = stack.pop()\n",
    "   print(top_element)  # Output: 3\n",
    "   print(stack)        # Output: [1, 2]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **peek()**: Returns the top element without removing it.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   top_element = stack[-1]\n",
    "   print(top_element)  # Output: 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the stack is empty.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = []\n",
    "   is_empty = len(stack) == 0\n",
    "   print(is_empty)  # Output: True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   stack = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   size = len(stack)\n",
    "   print(size)  # Output: 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy Level\n",
    "1. Create a stack and push the numbers 1 to 5 onto it. Print the stack.\n",
    "2. Pop the top element from the stack and print the result.\n",
    "3. Check if the stack is empty and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intermediate Level\n",
    "1. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use the `pop()` method to remove all elements and print each one.\n",
    "2. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use the `peek()` method to get the top element without removing it, then push the number 6 and print the stack.\n",
    "3. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use the `size()` method to get the number of elements, then pop two elements and print the new size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard Level\n",
    "1. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use a loop to pop all elements and store them in a list. Print the list.\n",
    "2. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use the `peek()` method to get the top element, then push the top element multiplied by 2 back onto the stack. Print the stack.\n",
    "3. Create a stack with the numbers 1 to 5. Use the `isEmpty()` method to check if the stack is empty, then pop all elements and check again. Print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure. The main operations are `enqueue` (to add an element to the end) and `dequeue` (to remove the front element).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queue Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **enqueue()**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from collections import deque\n",
    "   queue = deque()\n",
    "   queue.append(1)\n",
    "   queue.append(2)\n",
    "   print(queue)  # Output: deque([1, 2])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **dequeue()**: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   queue = deque([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   front_element = queue.popleft()\n",
    "   print(front_element)  # Output: 1\n",
    "   print(queue)          # Output: deque([2, 3])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **peek()**: Returns the front element without removing it.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   queue = deque([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   front_element = queue[0]\n",
    "   print(front_element)  # Output: 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **isEmpty()**: Checks if the queue is empty.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   queue = deque()\n",
    "   is_empty = len(queue) == 0\n",
    "   print(is_empty)  # Output: True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   queue = deque([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   size = len(queue)\n",
    "   print(size)  # Output: 3\n",
